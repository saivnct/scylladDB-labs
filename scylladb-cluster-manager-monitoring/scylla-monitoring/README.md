# Scylla Monitoring Stack

The ScyllaDB Monitoring Stack is used to monitor ScyllaDB.
It is container-based and has dashboards and some scripts to set up the containers.

Before using it, make sure you have docker enabled.
Check the [documentation](https://monitoring.docs.scylladb.com)
for installation and configuration details.

You can ask questions and discuss ScyllaDB Monitoring in the [ScyllaDB community forum](https://forum.scylladb.com/) and on the [Slack channel](http://slack.scylladb.com/).

The [Monitoring lesson](https://university.scylladb.com/courses/scylla-operations/lessons/scylla-monitoring/) on ScyllaDB University is another useful resource, and it includes a hands-on example.
