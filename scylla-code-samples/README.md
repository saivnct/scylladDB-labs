# Scylla Code Samples

This repository holds ScyllaDB usage examples, from simple to more complex.

## Adding a new example

Add a new directory with your example. Each example (directory) should have a README.md file with the following:

- Short description of the example
- How to build the example
- Prerequisites
- The version of ScyllaDB, and other packages, used in the example. I.E.:
  - ScyllaDB 5.2
  - Spark 2.0.2
* How to clean up the installation


Contributions should be submitted as pull requests.

## Further reading

Many of the examples are explained in detail in the [Mutant Monitoring System (MMS) and Integrations course](https://university.scylladb.com/courses/the-mutant-monitoring-system-training-course/) on ScyllaDB University. 

You can ask questions and discuss these code samples in the [ScyllaDB community forum](https://forum.scylladb.com/) and on the [Slack channel](http://slack.scylladb.com/).
